# Welcome to the InsideX project
InsideX enables you to monitor transactions by top holders (so called "insiders") of your favorite token(s).

# See what it looks like: install the extension on your local machine

1.  Navigate to  `chrome://extensions`  in your browser. You can also access this page by clicking on the Chrome menu on the top right side of the Omnibox, hovering over  **More Tools**  and selecting  **Extensions**.
2.  Check the box next to  **Developer Mode**.
3.  Click  **Load Unpacked Extension**  and select the directory for your "Hello Extensions" extension.

Congratulations! You can now use your popup-based extension by clicking the InsideX icon at the top right of your navigator.
